Chat with URLs - Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run the Streamlit app that scrapes web content using crawl4ai, processes it with ollama, and allows interactive Q&A.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+

Git (optional but recommended)

Step 1: Clone the Repository (Optional)

If you are using a repository, clone it first:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>

Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages from requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Set Up Playwright

Playwright is required for crawl4ai. Install and set it up with:

playwright install

This installs the necessary browser drivers for web scraping.

Step 4: Install and Run Ollama

Ollama is required for processing chat requests using the llama3.2 model.

Install Ollama

Download and install Ollama from the official website:

Windows/macOS/Linux: https://ollama.ai/download

Run Ollama

Once installed, start the Ollama service:

ollama run llama3.2

This downloads and runs the llama3.2 model if not already installed.

Step 5: Run the Streamlit App

Start the Streamlit application with:

streamlit run app.py

This will launch the web UI, allowing you to enter URLs, process content, and ask questions based on the scraped data.

Troubleshooting

If ollama is not found, ensure it is correctly installed and added to your system's PATH.

If Playwright scraping fails, try reinstalling Playwright browsers:

playwright install

If you encounter ModuleNotFoundError, ensure dependencies are installed with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Additional Notes

The ollama model runs locally, ensuring privacy and efficiency.

crawl4ai uses Playwright to extract content from web pages effectively.

Streamlit provides a simple UI for interactive Q&A based on the scraped content.

Now, you're all set! ðŸš€ Open the Streamlit app and start chatting with URLs.
